### Java Shorts

Short little java programs that I make as I learn.
Very scattered in purpose.

Currently I have

1. primeSieve - print out primes up to 10 (hardcoded)
2. primes - print out primes up to an input (AKA fun with methods)
3. fibonacci - print out the Fibonacci sequence up until an input
4. pascal - print out Pascal's triangle for a given number of lines
5. stopwords - strip the stopwords from a (hardcoded) wikipedia page
6. fern - plot a fern
